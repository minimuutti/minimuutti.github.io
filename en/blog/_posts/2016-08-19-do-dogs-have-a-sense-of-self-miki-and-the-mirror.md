Miki often looks at the reflection from a mirror like nothing to it.

Today he sat in front of a mirror and licked his nose and yawned several times looking at the reflection the whole time. Then something odd happened...

After about two minutes of him looking at the yawning dog from a mirror he raised his paw and weawed it in the mid air slowly, simultaneously looking at the reflection doing the same thing.

It appeared to me like he was trying to figure out if he was looking at himself.
