Retractable leashed are really dangerous and I've witnessed the worst nightmare that can happen with them.

We passed a dog on our walk that was on the other side of the road. The other dog flipped out when we passed them and started lunging towards us. The other dog's owner was holding on to a retractable leash when the worst thing happened..

The retractable leash gave in and the dog lunged to the road towards Miki and was hit by a passing car. The dog was twitching for a couple of times before he died on the spot.

Every one of us love our dogs and now is finally the time to change those dangerous retractable leashes to a regular leash.

R.I.P.
