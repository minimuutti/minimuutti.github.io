We were about to visit my fianc√©s parents who has an own yard with trees. So I came up with an idea of these treat necklaces which I could hang from a tree for Miki.

I took three clips of yarn, each clip was about two meters long. I folded them in half so they each became about one meter long. Then I took a few chevy treats and wired the yarn with needle through them. I used pieces of semi-moist chicken filet, semi-moist duck filet and beef stick pieces. Then I tied the treat necklaces onto a branch of a tree.

It took Miki about 2 to 3 minutes to eat all the treats.

You can also hang the treat necklaces from ladders or railings. You may not want to hang them on door handles, because I know Miki likes to scratch anything that he is pursuing after.
