For this game you need a cardboard box with a lid, masking tape and any kind of treats. You should choose a shallow cardboard box, so that your dog can reach the treats on the bottom when he puts his nose through those holes. The box we used, was 10 cm (4") high.

I drew five circles in the bottom of the box and cut them open with a modelling knife. I'm sure you can cut them open with scissors too. Then I closed the lid and the sides with masking tape and sprinkled the kibbles in.

It took Miki about four minutes to eat all the kibbles.

You can make this game harder by placing a few tennis balls or other small balls in the box with the treats. We haven't try this yet, because we don't have enough suitable balls at the moment.
