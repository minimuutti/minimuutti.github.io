For the honor of late summer, I did these cones inspired by ice cream cones :) for Miki.

I used carton coffee cups for this game and I put one treat in each cup. I cut about 5 cm (2") piece of Planet Pet Society Chicken Stick and pushed it to the bottom of the cup so that it got stuck in there. Then I put Kong toys or tennis balls on the top. I also pushed the tennis balls and the Kong toys as deep as possible.

It took Miki about two minutes to get all the treats out from those three cups.
