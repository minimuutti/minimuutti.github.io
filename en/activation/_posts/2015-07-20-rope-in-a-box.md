We have this 20 meters (about 60 feet) long rope that we use as a leash when we go swimming or playing football with Miki. Miki is so pray driven, that we can’t let him roam free without a leash. We have so much rabbits, squirrels and geese around here that we are afraid that Miki gets hit by a car when he goes and chase them over the street.

So I put this rope into a cardboard box and take the metal snap hook out. Then I divide Miki’s kibbles roughly in four portions and sprinkle them in the box and let Miki search them.
