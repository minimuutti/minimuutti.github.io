At first I thought of making a ball pool in the cardboard box, but the balls would have cost about 50 euros so I ended up improvising.

In this box full of toys we have for example rope toys, stuffed animal, different kinds of balls, empty treat tubes, a small towel, Kong toys, empty soda bottles etc. The items should be soft or rounded, so your dog doesnâ€™t hurt his nose while he is plowing in the box to get the treats.

I usually put 10 to 15 pieces of wiener in the box, one at a time, and let Miki search for them.
