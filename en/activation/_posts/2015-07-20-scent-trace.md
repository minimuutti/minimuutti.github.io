In the house, you can hide one piece of cheese or meat. Before hiding it you can draw a scent trace on the floor and the dog finds the treat by following the scent trace. When I draw the scent trace, Miki waits in the balcony.

If you are one of the lucky ones to have an own yard, you can make stock from the drain in tuna can mixed with water or you could just pour meat stock or fish stock in the yard too. Then put the treat in the end of the trace. In this case, the dog needs to wait inside or somewhere that he cannot see where you put the actual treat. You may wanna start this game with short distances and gradually make the distance longer.
