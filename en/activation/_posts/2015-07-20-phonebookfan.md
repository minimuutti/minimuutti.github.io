You need a phonebook or a mail order catalog and some kibbles for this one. Make sure that the pages are glued to the book, not stapled.

I stucked down part of the pages in the phonebook (the picture will tell more) and put the kibbles in between them.

In the first time it took Miki about ten minutes to ”read” the book and to find all the kibbles. In the second time Miki shredded the phonebook in two minutes :D
