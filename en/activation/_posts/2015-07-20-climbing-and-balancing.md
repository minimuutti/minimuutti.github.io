On our daily walks I often ask Miki to climb onto various things, such as rocks, trunks of fallen trees, stumps, benches etc. At the top I ask Miki to perform some of the tricks that I’ve taught to him.

Sitting on a bench or on a rock is easy. But backing up along fallen tree trunk and turning around on it, isn’t as easy.

You always need to make sure that the thing you require your dog to jump on or to climb on is secure and his paws won’t slip to prevent any injuries.
