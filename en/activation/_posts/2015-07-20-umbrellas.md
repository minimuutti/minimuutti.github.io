For this one you only need an umbrella and any treats. Just open an umbrella and place it on the floor and sprinkle the treats under it.

I opened and placed the umbrella on the floor while Miki was waiting in another room, so that the umbrella wouldnâ€™t seem scary. Then I called Miki and put the treats under the umbrella and gave him the permission to eat.

At second time I used two umbrellas, but you can use as many as you like.
