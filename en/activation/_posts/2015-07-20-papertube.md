For this one you only need two or three pages from the magazine (staples taken out), masking tape and some dry treats.

I put the pages side by side and taped them together on both sides. Then I put the treats on top of it and rolled it into a tube. I folded the tube and put some masking tape on it to make it harder.

The tube was shredded about in one minute.
