For this one you only need an empty DVD case and some treats that fits in the case. I put some grated cheese in it. Also I cut off the plastic cover holder, because it seemed sharp (Miki could have cut his mouth with it). 

This took Miki about one and a half minutes to get the case open. If this is as easy for your dog, you could put some maskingtape around it, as I have planned to do in the next time.
