We practise calming down by capturing/marking it as Miki does it by his self. When Miki lies down by my side, I give him a treat (which I always have a couple in my pocket, just in case). I lay the treat down right in front of Miki, so that heâ€™s not attempted to get back up on his feet.

Miki gets the next treat by staying in down position like a minute or two. Also if he puts her head on the floor too, he gets the treat.

You can also capture the calm behaviour when the dog is lying on his mat or in his bed.
