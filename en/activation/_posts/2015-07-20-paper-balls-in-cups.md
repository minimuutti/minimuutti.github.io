To make paper balls, take one page from a magazine. Then put some treats or just kibbles on the top of the paper and then scrunch it into a ball.

I put one paper ball in each cup, but you can put several paper balls in each cup if you like.

It took Miki about 5 minutes to get all the kibbles out.

Later on, you can make this game harder by pushing the paper balls flat onto the bottom of the cups with another cup. But this game is extremely hard with plastic cups, so you may want to start with the easier game. And for this harder game you may want to use some of your dog's favourite treats (not just kibbles). We played this harder game only with paper cups, not with plastic cups.
