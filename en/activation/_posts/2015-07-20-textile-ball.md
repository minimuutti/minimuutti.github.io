If you are about to throw away any old clothes, sheets or towels: don’t. Cut them to 5 cm (2”) wide shreds and attach them to each other with knots. This “yarn” should be at least 10 m (33 feet) long, mine was 12 m (40 feet) long and I cut a single shred from a t-shirt (the first picture).

Then just roll it to a ball an put any dry treats in between, I used kibbles and some soft chicken sticks. If you want, you can tie the end under the lower layers. The ball was about 10 cm (4”) in diameter.

It took Miki 12 minutes to get all the treats out.
