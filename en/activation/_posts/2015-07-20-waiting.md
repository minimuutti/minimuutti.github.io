Waiting can be so hard for some dogs.

At the moment Miki is able to wait while I put the kibbles or other treats on his feet when he is lying down. Miki can eat the treats only when I give him the permission.

It would be so cool to someday put the treat on his nose while he waits the permission to eat it.
