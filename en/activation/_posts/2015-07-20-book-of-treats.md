To this game you need thick cardboard, 2 to 4 zip ties and some thin and sticky treats.

I cut 4 pieces of cardboard size 20 x 20 cm (about 8" x 8"). You can also do this even with two pieces of cardboard or as many as you like.

I punched two holes with scissors in every cardboard piece, one hole at each side. You don't want to punch those holes too close to the edge, otherwise the cardboars can rip when you tighten the zip tie in there. I put the holes about 2-3 cm (1") from the edge.

After this I joined the cardboard pieces with zip tie from one end (see the first picture), and I trimmed the zip tie's tail off.

I knew that I needed to find some thin treats for this that needed to be sticky too, so that they wouldn't fall out. Semi-moist duck filets were the perfect choice for this. They are thin and sticky and certainly won't fall out.

So I took two of these duck filets and cut them in half, so that I got four pieces. I put two pieces in the middle gap and one piece in each gap on the sides. Then I put the other zip tie in the other holes that I made earlier and pulled it tight. Then I trimmed the zip tie's tail off.

It took Miki under five minutes to get the treats out.

This game is really convenient, because you can make it semifinished in the weekend. Then at some busy weekday just put the treats in and close it and give it to your dog :)
