I put a small amount of water in the yoghurt cup and then put pieces of wiener there and then I put it in the freezer for two hours. Miki got the treats out about in a minute.

Last time I did this, I put 1,5 cm (about 0,5 inch) of water in a larger cup, and I froze it without the treats. When this was frozen I added the treats and then put more water on top and froze it again. This time it took Miki about 20 minutes to get the treats out.
