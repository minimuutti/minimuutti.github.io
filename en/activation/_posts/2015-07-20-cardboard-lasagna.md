You need a good size cardboard box, a magazine (staples taken out) and some kibbles. Separate the pages from the magazine and lay them in the box on top of each other and put the kibbles in between.

As you can see in the picture, Miki took a shortcut and knocked the box over and ate the kibbles from the floor.
