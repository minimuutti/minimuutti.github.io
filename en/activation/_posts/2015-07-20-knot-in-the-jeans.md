You need a pair of jeans that you are about to throw away and some dry and hard treats.

Cut one leg off the jeans. You can put single treat in the leg and tie one knot on top of the treat. Or you can put a knot in the far end of the leg, then put the treat in the middle and put another knot at the other end of the leg.
