You can make lots of fun games with just a towel and a box. You can put some treats on the bottom of the box or you can hide some other small games in the box under the towel. Here are some examples.

### Variation 1

I put some treats on the bottom of the box and then I just laid the towel on top of the box. It took Miki about 30 seconds to find all the treats.

### Variation 2

I put some treats on the bottom of the box. After this I laid the towel on top of the box and then I fold the edges under the box. It took Miki under a minute to find all the treats.

I put some treats on the bottom of the box. Then I fold the towel and I put some treats in foldings as well and then I placed the towel in the box. It took Miki about two minutes to find all the treats.

### Variation 6

I put four small towels and one big towel in to the box. I folded or scrunched them and put about ten dry and hard treats altogether inside of them.

Miki found all the treats in two minutes.
