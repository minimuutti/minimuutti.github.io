You can buy expensive ball pool balls from a toy store and pay a fortune, or you can improvise like I did. I bought a bag of water balloons and they cost me next to nothing :)

I filled less than 100 balloons with air by using a bicycle pump and put them in a box as a ball pool. Then I sprinkled some kibbles in there and asked Miki to search.

Miki loved these balloons so much that he offered me the meercat trick as a compensation in order to get one of those balloons to play with, when I started to fill them :)
