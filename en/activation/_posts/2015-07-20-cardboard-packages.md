All small grocery packages that are made out of cardboard are good to be given to the dog to shred. I usually put some kibbles inside these.

These packages are so easy for Miki, that I always tape them around before giving them to Miki. Miki shreds a taped package in about two minutes.

The biking helmetâ€™s box was surprisingly hard for Miki, because there was this floor in the middle where the treats got stuck.

If this is too easy for your dog, you can hang these packages from trees, railings or ladders, so the dog must first get the package down before he can start to tear it apart.
