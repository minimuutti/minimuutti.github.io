I often hide the kibbles (about 50 to 100) around the apartment. Or I could just hide one piece on meat or cheese in the whole apartment. When I do the hiding, I put Miki on the balcony to wait so he doesn’t see whee I put the kibbles.

You need to hide the kibbles only in those areas you are comfortable for your dog to go. For example Miki doesn’t have a permission to climb on the sofa or any other furniture, so I hide the kibbles relatively close to the floorlevel.
