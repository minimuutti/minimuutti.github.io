Twenty minutes of activating for a dog is about equivalent to two hours of walking. That should be enough to drain the energy for most of the dogs. We walk with Miki about three hours in every working day and three to four hours in the weekend days. Adding to this, we activate Miki between one to one and a half hours every day.  In the autumn, winter and spring we also go running with him a couple times of week. And with running I really mean running, where Miki can pull on the pullharnesses, not jogging.

### Nose work
Any type on nosework games and finding games are good ways to activate your dog.

If your dog hasn’t searched for anything before, you should start by throwing a couple of treats to the floor in front of your dog so that he can see them and give a command: search (when he goes and eat the treats).
Only after this you can make the searching games harder. You can throw the treats in the sidewalk, or in the short grass. Later on you can throw the treats in the long grass on even in the snowdrift. On the outside you should always be very careful, because you can’t always be sure if there isn’t any broken glass or other dangerous things in the thick, long grass. Or there could be something hidden, that you may not like your dog to eat, like used papertissues or chewing gums.

Here you can find various nosework and finding game ideas for your dog.,

### Problemsolving

You can arrange various of problemsolving tasks for your dog, and these are good ways to drain your dogs energy. When the dog really needs to work something out in order to get his food, he will get tired. Here you can find multiple problemsolving tasks as well.

You should never help your dog with the tasks you’ve given to him, because when the dog figures something out by his self, it drains the energy.
