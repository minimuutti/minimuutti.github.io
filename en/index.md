### First about Miki and something about me too

Miki (means small in inuite language) was born on August 2012. He is a mixed-breed dog. Miki’s mother is an Alaskan Malamute and his father is a Finnish Lapphund, so that’s why we call Miki a minimute. In his heart, he is 100% malamute. Miki’s litter had 8 puppies, and he was the puppy number one. He was always the first to eat, he was the first that came to greed us when we first met the dogs and we were told that Miki used to eat his parents foods as well.

Alaskan Malamutes have been bred to pull heavy sledges in harsh conditions without getting tired. Malamutes are one of the smartest dog breeds and they are very clever as well.

Miki’s nickname is "wolf". Miki is not a wolf-dog hybrid, but he is primal and certainly looks like a small wolf, so we call him wolf. Both kids and adults spot Miki amongst other dogs because of his looks. At least once in a week we hear someone call him wolf. You can look pictures of Miki in [here](/en/pictures-of-miki/).

I usually describe Miki as energetic, lives his life to the fullest, he really loves humans (friends or complete strangers) and he is always eager to do almost anything and he likes to try new things head on. But, there’s a backside of all this.. he almost never drains out of energy. He just keeps going and going and going.

He can be also described as a reactive dog because his bucket gets filled quite fast when he sees other dogs on our walks. I believe that most of the energetic dogs who are labeled as "problem dogs", has the greatest motivation to work for humans like Miki does. You only need to see that eagerness through the problems. I love Miki because he never refuses to do anything when there’s a food reward available. Fortunately Miki has bottomless stomach and endless appetite :D

The best way to draind your dog’s energy, is by doing the thing he was bred for in the first place. Before Miki came in to our life, we had imagined that we would teach him to pull sled or a bicycle or something like that. We did begin to teach pulling to him, but he seemed to enjoy every other kind of things, but pulling. Miki pulls a bicycle like a minute and then gets bored to it. So we had to think something else to drain all that energy.
Some dogs can be labeled as easy, but Miki is as far from that as could be. Even when we arrive home after three hours of walking, Miki comes sitting in front of me and looks at me, like he was saying "that walking was fun, what are we doing next, let’s do something fun!" In the last autumn we were picking blueberries in the thick forest for four hours. When we came home Miki dropped down to the hallway floor and falled asleep right away. I already had thought myself "yes, at least once we managed to a walk so long that Miki is so tired that he went sleeping right away." But, after ten minutes of sleeping, Miki came to me and gave me THAT look again "now I have slept, what fun do we do next" :D 

We live in an apartment with Miki, so many people think that we are out of our minds. Our friends usually ask what kind of things or furnitures Miki has destroyed when he has been left home alone or when he was a puppy. None of them believes the answer: nothing. He didn’t destroy anything even when he was a puppy. We had a crate for him when he was a puppy, but we mainly used it to house train him.

### Then something about me

I have loved all kinds of animals my whole life. I spend almost all my "off work" time with Miki at the moment. I study canine bodylanguage and also how human bodylanguage affects a dog. I like photographing very much and I tend to have my camera with me all the time.

I’m an HSP – highly sensitive person. This has been a huge advantage in living with a reactive dog. I notice every small change in the environment and also every change in Miki – as small as he moving one whisker from the corner of my eye :) I have very strong intuition and I *know* things no one has ever told me. For example I have trained Miki, or we have walked past other dogs in a certain way, that I just *knew* was the right thing to do. Later on I might have read some studies or articles written by dog training professionals telling that the way I already have acted is the best or the most efficient method in those situations. Sometimes it can be a little scary :)

I think (*know*) that animals can be highly sensitive as well, although I’ve only heard people been described as HSP. I see Miki as a very sensitive creature and that’s why he reacts so strongly. In my experience the reasons for the (bad) behaviour on reactive dogs – and for me as well – comes from too overwhelming and taxing environment. The poor thing just needs to get the heck out of there - fast. As Pet Professional Guild wrote "A reactive dog is not *giving* you a hard time - he's *having* a hard time". 

For example I can have a conversation with one person without getting too tired. But if I have to be in a situation that involves two or more people, it’s just too overwhelming for me and it drains all my energy in seconds. After a situation like that anybody that comes to me gets to feel my “anger” in their skin :D It’s just the same thing for Miki. First couple of dogs that pass us on our walks triggers usually no big reactions in Miki, unless one of them is overexcited. Once we encounter one overexcited dog walking towards us or if there just has been too many dogs altogether, it’s like game over. After that we can’t walk past any dog – regardless of how calm or friendly they are. Everything becomes suddenly just too much and the poor dogs that pass us gets to feel Miki’s anger on their skin. Not literally :) (Fortunately these scenarios are rare thesedays.)

Nowadays when I notice that Miki’s bucket is about to fill, I first tie a yellow bandana on Miki’s leash. (You can also see yellow bandanas on other types of dogs that needs more space like fearful, anxious, sick, aggressive or old dogs who just couldn’t care less of other dogs.) Then we make a fun and quick exit before his bucket flows over. We have practiced some different exit strategies that I use depending on the situation. It's important to leave the situation so that your dog is left with positive feelings about what just happened. The most important thing in training a reactive dog is that you should never allow the bucket to fill completely – always plan your exit before that happens.

I got the idea for this site, because I couldn’t find enough mental activation tips for dogs from the Internet. Most of the pages I found, listed only a few tips, but I didn’t find any pages that would’ve had multiple tips in the same place.

I hope you enjoy the journey with Minimute and I hope that these pages can help your daily life with your own energetic dog.
