I made a diy kibble dispenser out of two deep paper plates.

First I cut a small hole in the side of one plate. Then I put the plates against each other and then I attached them with some packing tape.

This game was relatively hard for Miki, so I suggest that you do two or three holes in the plates instead of just one.

It took Miki about 5 minutes to get the kibble out.
