For this one you only need an umbrella and any treats.

Just open an umbrella and place it on the floor and sprinkle the treats under it. It may seem too easy, but actually it takes some courage for a dog to go under them.

I opened and placed the umbrella on the floor while Miki was waiting in another room, so that the umbrella wouldnâ€™t seem scary. Then I called Miki and put the treats under the umbrella and gave him the permission to eat.

At second time I used two umbrellas, but you can use as many as you like.
