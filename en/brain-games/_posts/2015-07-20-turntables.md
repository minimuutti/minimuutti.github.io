It takes tome effort to craft the game, but the end result is worth it.

For turntables you need a shallow cardboard box, some thin cardboard, four zip ties or two brads, glue and two small items to be used as handles.

First I drew two circles on to the box and then I cut them open with a modelling knife. Then I took some thin cardboard and I drew two slightly larger circles on it and then I cut them out too. These will be the lids to the holes. The lids were about 1,5 cm (0,6") larger in diameter than the holes.

If you don't have a modelling knife, don't worry. You can use scissors as well.

After this I made small holes to both ends of the box and also to the edges of the lids as well (marked with red X in the last picture). I attached the lids to the box with zip ties, but you can use brads as well. (Look at the last picture. Click on it to see a larger picture.)

When the lids were attached, I took two small plastic lids from treat tubes that I was going to use as handles. I attached the handles to the lids with glue. You can use any two small items as handles as long as you'll be able to attach them to the lids. If you don't have any suitable small items, you can use two small cardboard pieces.

The glue I used, wasn't as good as I had hoped. The handles detached as you can see in the pictures, because Miki was so enthusiastic DJ&nbsp;&nbsp;:D (I needed to reglue the handles couple of times).

This game was easy for Miki and it took Miki about 15 to 20 seconds to figure it out.
