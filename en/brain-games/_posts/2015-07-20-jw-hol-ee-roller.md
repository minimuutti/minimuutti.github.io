JW Hol-ee Roller toy (size L) is one of the best toys we have bought for Miki, because it's so versatile.

The toy was quite expensive but I think it was money well spend. Here are some of the games I have done for Miki with this ball.

### Rolled hand towel

I rolled a small hand towel into a long tube and I put some kibble inside. Then I tucked the towel into the ball.

It took Miki under 10 minutes to get all the kibble out.

### Wired hand towels

I rolled two small hand towels into long tubes and I put some kibble inside them. Then I wired both towels throught the holes of the ball.

It took Miki under 10 minutes to get all the kibble out.

You can alter this game if you secure the ball onto something.

### Paper balls

I made 10 paper balls, which I tucked inside the ball. I put some kibble inside each paper ball and when I had tucked all the paper balls inside the ball, I put some extra treats in between the paper balls.

It took Miki over ten minutes to get all the kibble out.

### Textile ball

This game needs a little more time and effort but I still recommend you to try this, because this game is fun for the dog and fun to watch :D

It took Miki about 10 minutes to get all the treats out.

You can find the directions how to make a textile ball in [here](/en/brain-games/textile-ball/).
