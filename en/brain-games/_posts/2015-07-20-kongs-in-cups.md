If food dispensing toys are too easy for your dog, you can make some of them more difficult by combining them with other objects.

First I put a small handful of kibble in a plastic cup. Then I put some kibble in the Kong Genius Leo toy and then I pushed the toy in the cup.

It took Miki about four minutes to get all the kibble out.

You just need to find the right size cups for your dog's Kong toys. At the second time I put some kibble in three cups and then I pushed Classic Kong toys as obstacles.

It took Miki about two of minutes to get all the kibble out.
