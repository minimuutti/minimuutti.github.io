Are treat dispensing toys too easy for your dog too? You can make some of the toys more difficult with a piece of fleece.

The piece of fleece I've used with the toys is under one meter long and about 10cm (4'') wide.

##### Kong Traxx

I put treats inside the toy and then I wired the fleece through the toy three times.

It took Miki about 7 minutes to get all the treats out.

##### Kong Wishbone

I put left over pieces of meat inside the toy and then I rolled the fleece around it and tied it with one knot.

It took Miki about 2 minutes to get all the treats out.

##### JW Caterpillar

I put some left over pieces of meat inside this toy also and then I rolled the fleece around it.

It took Miki about 10 minutes to get all the treats out.

##### Space ball stellaron

I used 6cm (about 2") wide piece of fleece with the stellaron toy. I cut small pieces of semi-moist duck fillet and rolled them inside the fleece before I wired the fleece through the toys holes. I also put three pieces of duck on top of the fleece.

It took Miki about 6 minutes to get all the treats out.

It seemed that Miki especially enjoyed these games, the result was this :)
