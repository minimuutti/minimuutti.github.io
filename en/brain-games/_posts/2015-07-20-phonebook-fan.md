You need a phone book or a mail order catalog and some kibble for this one.

Make sure that the pages are glued to the book, not stapled. I tucked down part of the pages in the phone book (the picture will tell more) and put some kibble in between them.

In the first time it took Miki about ten minutes to "read" the book and to find all the kibble. In the second time Miki shredded the phone book in two minutes.
