This is a confidence boosting game for your dog, by absolute-dogs.com. This is a great start if you need to train your dog to wear a muzzle.

I didn't have a cone so I improvised and used the top section of [Kong Wobbler](/en/treat-dispensers/kong-wobbler/) instead which was perfect for this game.

The idea of the game is that you put a treat inside the cone and your dog needs to put his muzzle inside in order to get the treat while you are holding it.

If your dog is shy or scared of the cone you can start rewarding your dog as he even approaches it or interacts with it some other way. Later on you can put a treat right on the edge of the cone and then gradually put the treat deeper.
