When this panda toy reached the end of his life it was still usable in Miki's daily activation.

When Miki was a puppy we bought him this Reverse-A-Ball Panda Soccer Ball toy. Miki played quite a lot with this toy when he was a puppy but later on he lost his interest.

I turned this toy into a panda so that there was a good size hole in the panda's stomach. I put some kibble in the hole and it took Miki about a minute to find all the kibble.

At the second time, I put kibble inside the panda and also inside a Kong toy. Then I put the Kong toy inside the panda and it took Miki about 3 to 4 minutes to find all the kibble. Poor panda :D
