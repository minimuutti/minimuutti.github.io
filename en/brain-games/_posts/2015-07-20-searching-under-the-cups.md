Get few cups from the kitchen or if you have small cardboard boxes or paper cups, you can use them too.

If your dog isn’t familiar with nose work and he hasn’t searched anything before, you want to start this game easy as well. Put a treat or two in the floor and ask for you dog to search. After this you can have one of those cups, and hide the treat under it (face the cup down on the floor) while the dog is watching and then ask for him to search it.

After a couple of easy search games you can make this harder. Then you can put multiple cups in the floor and only one treat in one of them. Or you can make it even harder by changing the cups to dinner plates or kettle lids, which are hard for dogs to lift or turn around.

If you put over 10 cups you may want to put more treats than just one.
