The dog is supposed to pull the towel out so he can get the treats. 

In this game I put two books on the floor, placed a towel between them and then I put a couple of treats on top of the towel and finally I put a basket/a glass pan on top of the books.

You should hold on the basket/glass pan, so that your dog doesn't try to push it over (like Miki tried at first) or that the heavy glass pan doesn't fall on your dog's paw.

Miki learned this game very fast and it took only seconds for him to pull the towel out with his paw.

You can adjust the level of the game a bit by altering how much the towel is out. You can also fold the towel and hide the treat inside the towel.
