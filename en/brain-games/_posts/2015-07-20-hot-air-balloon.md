The hot-air balloon is a completely different game that Miki is used to.

I put a dinner plate into a bucket and then I put some kibble on the plate. Then I put a beach ball on top of the bucket. I blew up the beach ball only semi-full, so that Miki wasn't able to puncture it with his teeth and so that it fit better into the bucket.

Miki thought that the beach ball was so fun and amazing that when he got the ball off from the bucket he forgot the kibble all along. Miki just wanted to play with the ball, but eventually the kibble vanished too.

It took Miki about a minute to get the ball off.
