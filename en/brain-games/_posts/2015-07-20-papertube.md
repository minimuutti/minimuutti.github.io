For this one you only need two or three pages from the magazine (staples taken out), masking tape and some dry treats or kibble.

I put the pages side by side and taped them together on both sides. Then I put the treats on top of it and rolled it into a tube. I folded the tube and put some masking tape on it to make it harder.

The tube was shredded about in one minute.

I also made a bigger tube with news paper. I rolled the sides on top of another and put some kibble in between the layers. I secured every layer with masking tape and when the tube was finished, I secured both ends with masking tape to keep the kibble in.

It took Miki about 10 minutes to get all the kibble out.
