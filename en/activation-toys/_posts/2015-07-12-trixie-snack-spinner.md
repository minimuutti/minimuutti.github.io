With Trixie Snack Spinner (size 14 cm) I use only kibbles. This toy has an adjustable middle floor, so you can adjust the difficulty of this toy. The hole in the bottom is so small, that anything bigger than kibbles isn’t going to fit through.

This toy has been one of the most expensive toys we’ve bought for Miki. At the same time it seems the toy is very fragile. Even though we haven’t used it that often it’s already breaking down.

It takes about three to four minutes for Miki to get all the kibbles out.
