In Kong Quest Star Pod (size L) I usually put these [Nutrivet Instinct Dog Treats](http://www.zooplus.fi/esearch.htm#q=dog%20treat). These are just the right size treats to be crammed in the holes around the toy. I just turn them sideways so that they wonâ€™t fall out.

Sometimes I put pieces of dried chicken filet instead in those holes. The filets are convenient because you can cut them to any shape and size.

It takes Miki about 2 to 3 minutes to get all the treats out, but with chicken filets it may take a couple of minutes longer.
