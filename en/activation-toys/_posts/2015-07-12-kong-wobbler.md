With Kong Wobbler (size L) I use kibbles. Miki learned the idea of this toy very quickly, and it only takes Miki about a minute or two to get all the kibbles out.

So then I wondered how I could make this otherwise great toy harder. I cut about 20 x 20 cm (about 8" x 8") piece from a towel, and put it in the toy along with the kibbles. That slowed Miki about a minute, so then it took Miki two or three minutes to get the kibbles out.

You could also put some tennis balls or some other soft balls inside the toy with the kibbles. We haven’t tried it yet, because we don’t have any suitable balls at the moment.
