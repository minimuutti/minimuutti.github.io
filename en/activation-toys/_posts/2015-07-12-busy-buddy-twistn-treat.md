In Busy Buddy Twist'n Treat (size L) I put kibbles.

You can adjust the difficulty of this toy. When this toy is adjusted to its hardest, Miki still gets the kibbles out in less than two minutes.

I recommend this toy anyway, because it's one of the cheapest toys we've bought for Miki and it seems to be really durable.
