We have bought many different treat dispensing toys to Miki. I highly recommend the Kong toys; they are pretty durable and pet stores usually have a good selection of them. 

Here Iâ€™ve written some examples how you can use treat dispensing toys with your dog and how much time it approximately took Miki to empty the treats from them. I will also tell you what type of treats I feel are the most suitable for each toy. However these are the treats Miki likes, but I hope this can give you some ideas.
