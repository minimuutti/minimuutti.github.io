We have bought many different treat dispensing toys for Miki. I highly recommend the Kong toys; they are pretty durable and pet stores usually have a good selection of them. 

Here are some examples how you can use treat dispensing toys with your dog and how much time it approximately took Miki to empty the treats from them. I will also tell you what type of treats I feel are the most suitable for each toy. However these are the treats Miki likes, but I hope this can give you some ideas.
