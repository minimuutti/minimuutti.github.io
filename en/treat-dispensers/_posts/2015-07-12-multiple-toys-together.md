The last kibbles are usually the hardest to get out from any treat dispencer. This is why I don’t put all the kibbles I’m going to give Miki in the same toy. Instead I divide the kibbles into two to five portions and put them in different toys and give them to Miki one at the time.

You can also join some toys together. For example the Classic Kong and Kong Traxx can be joined together. Kong Company says that the Kong Genius –toys are also connectable. Just stick a Kong Genius Leo into a Kong Genius Mike or stick multiple Leos together.
