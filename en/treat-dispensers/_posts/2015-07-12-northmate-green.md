In addition to normal food bowl, we have this slow feeding bowl that mimics grass, and this one is the larger one of the two available sizes.

Itâ€™s very seldom that we give any food to Miki in a bowl, Miki normally gets his daily portion from some brain games, treat dispensers or as a reward for learning new tricks. But this Northmate slow feeding bowl is a good buy. It takes Miki about 5 to 10 minutes to lick the bowl clean.
