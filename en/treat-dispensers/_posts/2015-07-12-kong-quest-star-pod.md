Kong Quest Star Pod is a durable toy and it's a good toy if you can find right size treats for it.

Kong manufactures this toy in many sizes and this is size L. I usually put these [Nutrivet Instinct Dog Treats](http://www.zooplus.fi/esearch.htm#q=dog%20treat) into the holes. These are just the right size treats to be crammed into the holes around the toy. I just turn them sideways so that they wonâ€™t fall out.

Sometimes I put pieces of dried chicken fillet instead in those holes. The fillets are convenient because you can cut them to any shape and size.

It takes Miki about 2 to 5 minutes to get all the treats out, but with chicken fillets it may take a couple of minutes longer.

Although the toy scores in durability, it's sometimes hard to find the right size treats for it.
