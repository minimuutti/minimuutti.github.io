JW Playbites Caterpillar toy is my new favourite, because it gives Miki a long-lasting challenge.

JW makes this toy in two different sizes and this is the larger one (20 cm).

Although this toy seems to be easy - it's not. It's actually quite difficult.

The time I put kibble in the holes, Miki got tired before he even got all the kibble out. Usually I put pieces of dried chicken fillet in the holes and it can take Miki over an hour to get all the treats out.
