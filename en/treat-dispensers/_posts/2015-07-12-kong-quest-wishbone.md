Kong Quest Wishbone is very durable toy but it doesn't give much of a challenge.

Kong manufactures this toy in many sizes and this is size L. The toy is made out of slippery rubber so it's very hard to chew through.

This toy is suitable also for freezing. It takes Miki about 10 minutes to lick the filled and frozen toy clean.

The first time I gave this toy to Miki I put some leftover pieces of meat in it, and the pieces were inhaled in about 10 seconds… :D Later on I've used pieces of chicken fillet or some treat sticks with this.

You can adjust the difficulty by choosing different size treats and the larger treats have usually been the hardest ones to get out.
