With Kong Genius Leo (size L) I usually use kibbles. Once I tucked in a dried chicken fillet in it but Miki decided to take a shortcut and tore the toy apart to get to the chicken. So, I had to go to the pet store to get a new one.

I also gave feedback to the Kong company. I suggested that they should manufacture the Genius toys from the black Extreme Kong rubber so that the Genius toys would last rougher mouthing.

Miki gets all the kibbles out from this toy in less than two minutes. In these pictures Miki plays with the toy for the first time.
